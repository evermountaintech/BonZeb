# Preface
BonZeb is a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) library for high-resolution behavioural tracking and analysis of zebrafish. 
Bonsai-Rx provides a useful programming framework for applications in behavioural neuroscience. 
BonZeb provides essential tools for zebrafish researchers looking to implement closed-loop and open-loop behavioural feedback, with a specific focus on visual stimulation.
BonZeb is built on top of the Bonsai framework and users will need to be somewhat familiar with Bonsai before getting started.
For more information, please check out Bonsai's forums at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/bonsai-rx/Lobby) and [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bonsai-users)
