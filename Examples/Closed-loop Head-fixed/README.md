# Closed-loop Head-fixed Stimulation
BonZeb's tracking methods can be used to implement closed-loop stimulation.
The examples provided address how closed-loop stimulation can be performed to stimulate optomotor swimming with OMR gratings.
These methods provide a general framework for users to develop closed-loop assays with other forms of stimulation.

# 1D Closed-loop with OMR
Below is an overview of the virtual open-loop workflow.
