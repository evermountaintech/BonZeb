BonZeb offers solutions for researchers looking to perform single and multi-animal tracking, analysis, closed-loop/open-loop stimulation, optogenetics, and calcium imaging.
In this section, users will learn how BonZeb works and how to implement these methods in Bonsai workflows.

I recommend reading the sections in the following order:
1. [Visual Stimulation](<Visual Stimulation>)
2. [Calibration](<Calibration>)
3. [Behavioural Tracking and Analysis](<Behavioural Tracking and Analysis>)
4. [Multi-animal Tracking](<Multi-animal Tracking>)
5. [Virtual Open-loop Free-swimming](<Virtual Open-loop Free-swimming>)
6. [Closed-loop Head-fixed](<Closed-loop Head-fixed>)
7. [Optogenetics](<Optogenetics>)
8. [Calcium Imaging](<Calcium Imaging>)
